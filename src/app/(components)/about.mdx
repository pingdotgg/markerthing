## Chop Your Streams In Record Time

Grab csv files from your Twitch [Stream Markers](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/creating-highlights-and-stream-markers?language=en_US#:~:text=in%20light%20purple.-,Stream%20Markers,-Stream%20Markers%20are) to use with [LosslessCut](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut), a phenomenal open source video cutting tool.

### ...why does this exist?

I wanted a better way to manage the markers from my streams. I use them as reference points to grab chunks of video for my editors. This app lets you see all the markers trivially as well as exporting them to a CSV file.

### My workflow:

- Stream on Twitch, record vod + footage on camera
- During stream, create new markers using \`/marker (name of marker)\` command
- End of stream, download CSVs from MarkerThing
  - I make a second offset CSV for my camera footage, since I start recording it after I start the stream
- Open LosslessCut, drag VOD in, drag CSV in, "export"
- ^ again, with camera recordings + offset CSV

This workflow takes me ~3 minutes, and it enables my team to quickly grab 5+ videos worth of content after every stream.

Let me know if this is useful! - [Theo](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg)
